          <h1>HOW DOES THIS REINFORCE THE CITY’S VISION?</h1>
          <h2>POINT FOR POINT COMPARISON</h2>
          <h3>HOW THE BLIGHT removal TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS SUPPORT DETROIT FUTURE CITY & THE MAYOR’S 10-POINT PLAN</h3>

          <p>A full listing of the 10 points from the Mayor’s Every Neighborhood Has a Future plan is below</p>

          <h4>MAYOR’S EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD HAS A FUTURE 10-POINT PLAN</h3>
          <p><strong>Point 1:</strong> Establish a single Department of Neighborhoods (DON).</p>
          <p><strong>Point 2:</strong>  Base the DON in 7 Neighborhood District Offices to create true 
          partnerships with Neighborhood Groups/Block Clubs.</p>
          <p><strong>Point 3:</strong>  Seize Abandoned Houses/Drug Houses through nuisance 
          abatement program Mike Duggan started as Prosecutor. </p>
          <p><strong>Point 4:</strong>  Create positive incentives to move families from sparsely 
          populated areas into stronger neighborhoods.</p>
          <p><strong>Point 5:</strong>  Rebuild neighboring business districts, beginning by seizing

          <p><strong>Point 6:</strong>  Streamline demolition process and strategically target 
          neighborhoods.</p>
          <p><strong>Point 7:</strong>  Crack down on illegal scrappers and their scrap yards.</p>
          <p><strong>Point 8:</strong>  Create much tougher code enforcement. </p>
          <p><strong>Point 9:</strong>  Require banks to participate in neighborhood redevelopment.</p>
          <p><strong>Point 10:</strong>  Reform Detroit Land Bank so we can re-use vacant land.</p>

          <p>Neighborhood-based point of contact through the Neighborhood District Manager Offices.</p>
          <h3>MAYOR’S EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD HAS A FUTURE</h3>

          <p>“Engage people with a mosaic of tactics that have varied and broad appeal and possibilities, and that are woven together to have combined effectiveness.”</p>
          <p>“Extend the capacity for civic engagement by building on four key components of long-term civic capacity: city government, philanthropy, Detroit institutions (including business and nonprofit sectors), and Detroit residents.”</p>
          <h2>WHAT DO WE KNOW?</h2>
          <ul><strong><li>84,641 out of 377,602 properties in Detroit need intervention.</li>
          <li>Most of these by far are residential: 73,035.</li>
          <li>The MCM team has identified about 40,077 structures that meet the Task Force definition of blight and should be removed.</li></strong></ul>

          <p>Helps pinpoint priority parcels for <strong>Point 8:</strong> Create much tougher code enforcement.</p></div>
          <h3>DETROIT FUTURE CITY</h3>
          <h4>City Systems</h4>
          “Actively manage change, by continuing discussions that have already begun for removing regulatory barriers to interagency cooperation at the city and regional levels, as well as establishing an interagency platform for coordinated decision making about city services.
          <h2>WHERE DO WE GO FIRST?</h2>
          <p>The goals of Maximizing Community Impact (MCI) are to:</p>
          <ul><li>Improve quality of life for the greatest number of people in the city, and </li>
          Improve opportunities for reinvestment in Detroit’s neighborhoods.</li></ul>
          <h3>MAYOR’S EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD HAS A FUTURE</h3>
          <p>Provides geographic analysis to support the Mayor’s entire code enforcement and nuisance abatement efforts, including <strong>Point 3:</strong> Seize Abandoned Houses/Drug Houses through nuisance abatement program.</p>
          <p>Provides geographic analysis to aid in decisions about how to enact <strong>Point 6:</strong> Streamline demolition process and strategically target neighborhoods.</p> 
          <p>Shows how priority areas for investment will dovetail with and benefit from Mayor’s efforts on <strong>Point 8:</strong> Create much tougher code enforcement.</p>
          <h3>DETROIT FUTURE CITY</h3>
          <h4>Land Use</h4> 
          <p>“Alliance with Framework Zones that guide citywide and investment decisions in terms of the best ways to make positive change in areas with a range of physical and market characteristics.”</p>
          <h4>Neighborhoods</h4>
          <p>“Address quality-of-life issues for all Detroiters with a set of citywide strategies that work in all Detroit neighborhoods.”</p>
          <h4>Economic Growth</h4
          <p>“Transform the city’s land into an economic asset.”</p>
          <h4>Land Assets</h4>  
          <p>“Use vacant public land and structures in neighborhoods to stabilize them.”</p>
          <p>“Link public facility and other decisions to larger strategies.”</p>
          <h2>HOW DO WE DECIDE WHAT TO DO?</h2>
          <ul><li>Legal tools to streamline blight removal and support Mayor’s code enforcement and nuisance abatement efforts.</li>
          <li>Strategic Assessment Triage Tool (SATT) to rapidly and consistently evaluate intervention options for each property.</li>
          <h3>MAYOR’S EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD HAS A FUTURE</h3> 
          <p>Recommends specific legal and procedural changes to support the Mayor’s code enforcement and nuisance abatement efforts, including <strong>Point 3:</strong> Seize Abandoned Houses/Drug Houses through nuisance abatement program.</p>

          <p>Recommends specific legal and procedural changes to support the<strong> Point 8:</strong> Create much tougher code enforcement.</p> 
          <p>The <strong>SATT</strong> is an entirely new diagnostic tool that will support the Mayor’s entire 10-point Neighborhood Plan because it will assure a first-ever ability to make consistent yet fine-grained decisions by parcel.</p>
          <h3>DETROIT FUTURE CITY</h3>
          <h4>City Systems</h4>
          <p>“Actively manage change, by continuing discussions that have already begun for removing regulatory barriers to interagency cooperation at the city and regional levels, as well as establishing an interagency platform for coordinated decision making about city services.”</p>
          <p><strong>The SATT tool offers two formal points for Community Engagement to shape and refine decisions at the beginning and near the end of SATT analysis, through presentations at community meetings:</strong></p>
          <p>“Develop and share knowledge and information inclusively, continually, with transparency, and demonstrating that the input has value and is being used.”</p>
          <p>“Engage people with a mosaic of tactics that have varied and broad appeal and possibilities, and that are woven together to have combined effectiveness.”</p>
          <h2>HOW DO WE REMOVE BLIGHT?</h2>
          <uL<li>Because demolition and deconstruction have such immediate transformative impacts, this chapter focuses on the removal of structures and the clearing and maintenance of vacant lots.</li>
          <li>Focus on safest available practices that can lead to economic opportunities and clear the way for healthier environments in Detroit.</li>
          <li>Highlights 430 job creation opportunities for Detroiters.</li></ul>
          <h3>MAYOR’S EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD HAS A FUTURE</h3>

          <p>“Support the Four Key Economic Pillars [including] industrial  “Encourage local entrepreneurship and minority-owned business.”</p>
          <p>“Improve education and skills development.”</p>
          <p>“Transform the city’s land into an economic asset.”</p>

          <p>“Make landscape interventions central to Detroit’s survival.”</p>
          <h2>HOW DO WE GET AHEAD OF BLIGHT?</h2>
          <ul><li>Promote property tax policy that levels the playing field for property assessments over the next two years.</li>
          <li>Stem the tide of properties at risk of foreclosure through auction bundling, owner occupied payment assistance, and reverter clauses.</li>
          <li>Key city and state actions are needed to enact or strengthen laws that prevent or address blight.</li></ul>
          <h3>MAYOR’S EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD HAS A FUTURE</h3>  
          <p>Supports local and state framework to target irresponsible owners and support:</p>

          <h2>WHO IS LEADING THIS PROCESS?</h2>
          <p>The Mayor’s Office must lead, in collaboration with the Emergency Manager’s office, to address blight head-on.</p>
          <p>The centerpiece of this work will be the newly enhanced Detroit Land Bank Authority, working in concert with the Mayor’s office and the Department of Neighborhoods.</p>

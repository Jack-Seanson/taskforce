            <h4>What is the context for our work?</h4>

            <section id="1">
                <p>
                    Detroit’s neighborhoods all have their own histories, their own challenges and needs, and their own opportunities. There is a future for every neighborhood in Detroit. That future does not include blight.</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Mayor’s 10-Point Plan for Neighborhoods has set the stage
                    for a blight-free future for Detroit’s neighborhoods. The significant strengthening of the Detroit Land Bank Authority was the first major step, along with reviving the city’s code enforcement and nuisance abatement initiatives, and the creation of the Department of Neighborhoods to coordinate city agencies and communicate with the public as Detroit engages head-on in fighting blight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tackling blight inevitably brings up the question, What comes next? The Task Force carried out its initiative during the same months that the City has begun to update Detroit’s Master Plan of Policies, which holds the keys to what kinds of land uses are permitted and encouraged in the city. The Mayor’s Office is amending the Master Plan to support the framework created through Detroit Future City in 2013.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In particular, Detroit Future City’s 50-Year land use forecast, annual priorities, and current pilot projects should guide the priorities for blight solutions in the coming years. These priorities will call upon the Mayor’s Office, Detroit Land Bank Authority, Wayne County, State of Michigan, Detroit Economic Growth Corporation, and business and community leaders to work closely together to realize many strategic opportunities for investment in Detroit’s employment areas and neighborhoods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every job—and every resident—is important to Detroit’s future. <strong>For the city’s economic alignment to yield its full potential, economic growth in Detroit must be fair and must benefit all of the city’s residents.</strong> This plan recognizes equitable growth not only because it is the right thing to do, but because it makes good business sense: By increasing Detroiters’ access to employment and entrepreneurship, the city will grow its base of workers and business owners, while increasing incentives for and investment in further education and training.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Detroit strengthens the key actors and assets within the city, it will also be able to tighten the linkages between the city and regional economies, maintaining its position as a global trade center. The vision of the Strategic Framework is a strong, equitable urban economy that anchors the revitalization of the larger metropolitan economy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Framework is also designed to be adaptable to the conditions in the regional, national, and international economies. The intent was to provide a framework for action that is flexible and dynamic, yet establishes a strong structure to support both growth and equal opportunities.
                </p>

                <h5>A day in the life: fulfilling our economic potential</h5>
                <p>
                    Darius lives in Northwest Detroit with his wife Barbara, a medical technician, and his two kids Bakari, 17, and Hope, 15. It’s been a tough decade, but things are looking up. Not too long ago Darius was unemployed because of cutbacks at the auto factory he’d worked at since high school. The only job Barbara could find was in the suburbs, and her daily commute began at 4:30 a.m. by bus so Darius could have the car.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How’d they recover? In 2012, the city government and its business partners began focusing on four key areas of job growth, including 21st century industrial work. Through a new training partnership between a local university and a foundation, Darius touched up his advanced- technology skills and landed a job within 60 days of receiving his certificate. Jobs in the city were picking up rapidly, since the city had focused its business development in seven strategic employment districts. Businesses locating in these districts attracted others in similar fields, and all of them were hiring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Barbara soon got a job, too, at a new clinic in the “Eds and Meds” district in the McNichols corridor. She takes one of the city’s rapid bus lines to work now, getting there in about 20 minutes. Bakari and Hope take the rapid bus to school, too, and they even take the bus to after- school activities at the library (SAT practice for Bakari, digital photography for Hope). With everyone’s commute time cut, dinner begins at 6 p.m. sharp: Just in time for a family report on everyone’s day.

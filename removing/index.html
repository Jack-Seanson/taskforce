            <h2>How do we remove blight?</h2>
            <p>The massive scale of blight in Detroit and urgency to address it requires that the city carry out the best practices possible to remove blight safely and efficiently. Although the Task Force recognized a wide array of possible interventions, we focused on the sensitive and complex area of deconstruction and demolition. We studied the experiences of other cities that tackled large-scale blight, such as Baltimore, New Orleans, and Cleveland, and collected the best information available to prepare our recommendations.</p>
            
            <p>This chapter includes information and recommendations on the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Neighborhood Structures</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Environmental Measures</li>
                <li>Deconstruction Opportunities</li>
                <li>Demolition Needs</li>
                <li>Recycling Potential</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Large-Scale Commercial Structures</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Prioritization</li>
                <li>Demolition Needs</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Clearing and Maintaining Vacant Lots</li>
              <li>Job Creation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our recommendations put people first by addressing resident and worker safety, recognizing the need to provide economic opportunities, and creating a path to healthier neighborhood environments.</p>
          </section>
          <section id="2">
            <h2>Removal of Structures</h2>
            <p>The Task Force grouped the 78,506 blighted structures into the following categories:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Residential Structures Four Units or Less (legally defined as single-family)</li>
              <li>Residential Structures Over Four Units (legally defined as multi-family)</li>
              <li>Commercial Structures with lot sizes smaller than 25,000 square feet</li>
              <li>Commercial Structures with lot sizes greater than 25,000 square feet</li>
              <li>Industrial Structures</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Because certain types of structures have similar characteristics for removal, we have grouped these five categories into two:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Neighborhood Structures,</strong> including all residential structures and commercial structures smaller than 25,000 square feet in lot size; and</li>
              <li><strong>Large-Scale Commercial Structures,</strong> including commercial structures with lots greater than 25,000 square feet, and industrial structures.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section id="3">
            <h2>Neighborhood Structures</h2>
            <p>Because neighborhood structures make up 98 percent of the total number of blighted structures in Detroit, the Task Force spent most of its time examining this category. Four major areas of activity were considered:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Environmental measures</li>
              <li>Environmental measures</li>
              <li>Deconstruction opportunities</li>
              <li>Recycling potential</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The Detroit Land Bank Authority should take the lead on these activities.</p>
            
            <h3>ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURES</h3>
            <p>Environmental work is broken into two phases: survey and abatement. The environmental survey is completed during the Strategic Assessment Triage Tool (SATT) process (discussed in Chapter 5). In known high risk areas, the results of the survey provide information about the levels of asbestos and lead in a structure. Combined with the requirements of environmental ordinances, these levels define the appropriate abatement measures for each structure.</p>
            <h4>ASBESTOS</h4>
            <p>The Task Force gathered information and best practices for asbestos abatement from several sources, including the Springwells Village pilot deconstruction project in Detroit, and several municipalities, including New Orleans, Baltimore, and Cleveland. The Task Force
            also gathered information from
            the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and examined past Detroit demolition activities. Asbestos regulatory and clearance practices are well documented and well enforced in many cities across the country, including Detroit. Because of that, the protocol is similar in many markets. The nuances largely exist around the varying abatement, hauling, and dumping across regions.</p>
            <p>In every case, an environmental survey is conducted inside the structure to gather and analyze materials. If contaminants are found, an abatement plan is sent to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality’s Air Quality</p>
            <p>Division to determine its compliance with the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP). No demolition or renovation work can occur on that structure for 10 working days while the State evaluates the plan. When the plan receives the green light for compliance, demolition can proceed. During demolition, debris must be hauled to a designated section of the landfill for disposal.</p>
            <p>The Task Force supports the
            current regulatory process for asbestos abatement. Our strongest recommendation in this area is to complete the environmental survey, utilizing the SATT, as soon as possible once the Detroit Land Bank Authority has gained legal authority to enter the premises.</p>
            <h4>LEAD</h4>
            <p>The Motor City Mapping tool indicates which properties might contain blighted structures, but MCM cannot help pinpoint where the greatest deposits of lead exist.</p>
            <p>The presence, density, and type of contaminants vary widely in Detroit, and even from one address to the next on the same street. The types and ages of building systems and surfaces offer some ability to predict which buildings tend to contain lead. For example, glossy paints manufactured throughout the 20th century until 1978 typically contain lead. There are no reliable ways, however, to predict the highest concentrations of lead with great accuracy.</p>
            <p>While asbestos abatement practices are fairly well known, studied, and documented, the same does not hold true for lead. Lead exposure and abatement is still mostly uncharted territory. The current code calls
            for a “wet” demolition to address dust mitigation, but does not speak specifically to lead.</p>
            <p>As with the asbestos research, the Task Force discussed lead exposure and abatement with the same sources previously noted. All subject matter experts, including Detroit, are still admittedly in the learning process and using a wide variety
            of abatement solutions. Given the uncertainty in this area, the Task Force partnered with Detroit Future City (DFC) to gain more insight and guide our recommendations.</p>
            <p><strong>LEAD: KNOWNS AND UNKNOWNS.</strong> Because Detroit’s building boom (the early- to mid- 20th century) coincided with the most intensive use of lead-containing materials in the construction industry, many of Detroit’s vacant structures contain serious concentrations of lead. The timing of Detroit’s fastest development almost certainly means higher concentrations of lead in its urban-architectural DNA than in cities that built out before the 20th century. We cannot always determine where lead is most prevalent in Detroit. Construction during the boom era was not contiguous, and different contractors used different materials. Maintenance practices at each property also influence the material- chemical signature of the property. The only “safe bets” are the houses that have already been burned significantly, for the greater physical depreciation, the lower the percent of total risk, in terms of blood-lead levels.</p>
            
            <p><strong>LEAD: UNACCEPTABLE CONSEQUENCES OF BUSINESS AS USUAL.</strong>
            Surprisingly, the removal of lead from structures before demolition is not presently regulated. By contrast, Federal and State law regulate approaches to the presence of asbestos in structures under NESHAP, and the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration (MIOSHA) regulates worker blood lead levels.
            </p>
            <p>Until April 2014, the city’s demolition contracts had specified the management of “visible dust emissions”. Without specifically mentioning lead, this procurement language lacks a clear, measured route to enforcement. Demolition contractors could essentially do whatever they want relative to lead levels, as long as they did not exceed EPA thresholds for air quality.</p>
            <p>With no adequate dust management techniques and routes to enforcement, the contaminated dust from the board-up, renovation, and demolition processes not only can contaminate the site itself, but also can travel across the neighborhood. High-force events, like demolition, tend to create larger volumes of dust, and a greater range of dust particle sizes.</p>
            <p>
            Another challenge related to lead contamination is in the protocol for processing materials, whether for paper pulp, burned as waste to energy, de- nailed for reuse in interior architectural projects, or processing through small wood manufacturing. If the materials are contaminated, they must be managed through a separate regulatory process and facility that changes the cost and ability of the repurposing (salvaging or deconstruction) of materials.</p>
            <p>Given the scale of Detroit’s concentrated blight removal efforts, our strategy should provide people with a high level of protection from lead contamination. However, this is likely to result in increased demolition costs and slower time frames. It stands to reason that both challenges must be resolved. The Task Force, the city and the Detroit Land Bank Authority all agree that going beyond the present legal requirements is the right thing to do.</p>
            <p><strong>LEAD: OPTIONS AND COSTS FOR MITIGATING LEAD EXPOSURE.</strong>
            A range of options exists for addressing the unknown presence and levels of lead in Detroit. One option is to add air-quality monitoring devices to every targeted area of blight removal, and to engage community groups in educating residents. Doing this will add some cost to each project, but will also raise safety awareness among the contractors and community.</p>
            <p>At the other extreme, a full lead risk assessment could be conducted for every blighted structure in Detroit. Because the initial environmental survey in the SATT is designed to provide initial insight into the location of lead, this extreme measure does not seem necessary, feasible, or even the best way to address lead contamination across the city’s geography because the lead levels are likely to be so varied.</p>
            <p><strong>LEAD: WHAT IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR DETROIT AND MICHIGAN?</strong>
            Detroit can craft the first-ever national standards and policies for lead-safe building removal practices, and can lead by example (and necessity) with its own best practices. Through pilot initiatives, Detroit can define a mechanism for determining how to evaluate the success of a health-risk managed blight removal processes. Testing and developing this environment also creates an opportunity for additional job creation.</p>
            <p>Some principles and approaches should guide Detroit’s innovation in creating national standards for safe, cost-effective, and large-scale blight removal:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Establishment of a baseline that draws from best practices from around the country to balance responsibility with cost and time effectiveness.</li>
              <li>Development of a pilot project (in conjunction with U.S. EPA) on an active demolition/deconstruction site to inform our work over the long term.
              This pilot should include a Heath Impact Assessment tool which offers a method for managing lead exposure and other environmental consequences associated with large scale blight removal.</li>
              <li>Leveraging of the pilot project to create a viable and measured way to monitor and enforce lead safety practices while demolition is happening. This should include some type of random sampling neighborhood-based air quality monitoring system and services, which can help in assuring contractor compliance.</li>
              <li>Evaluation of structural / parcel-based conditions for challenges around demolition for structures with lead exposure in densely populated areas.</li>
              <li>Allocation of space and resources throughout the lifecycle of a significant blight removal project for a feedback loop of continuous testing, implementing, and testing again to support process improvements over time. (In Baltimore, this approach saved 50 percent of anticipated health management costs.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>LEAD: WHAT PROACTIVE STEPS HAS THE CITY OF DETROIT ALREADY TAKEN?</strong>
            The City of Detroit, the Detroit Land Bank Authority (DLBA), and the Detroit Building Authority (DBA) recognize the lack of regulation around lead and how it is handled. At the same time they recognize the importance of creating a safe and healthy environment for Detroit residents. To that end, in April 2014 this team, along with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and Region 5 Environmental Protection Agency designed the approach summarized below to deal with this issue.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Complete a Health Impact Assessment pilot with respect to demolition and blight removal for the Hardest Hit Fund demolition program’s six target neighborhoods. This process is intended to establish baseline conditions for tracking the health status of each target neighborhood; describing health outcomes, health determinants, affected populations in locations with respect to demolition activities and estimates of current negative health/cost burden from blight. Findings will inform recommendations for a citywide demolition and blight removal process.</li>
              <li>Develop public information material regarding safety and protective measures for neighbors during demolition activities and ensure that they are distributed in all demolition neighborhoods</li>
              <li>Provide field liaisons, who are empowered to make site work decisions including work stoppage and assign them to make regular and unannounced visits to each active demolition to monitor activities, assure compliance with best practices, and address any neighborhood concerns.</li>
              <li>Require the following in all demolition bid specifications:
                <ul>
                  <li>Use of “wet/wet” demolition removal techniques</li>
                  <li>Use of Bucket Claw loading technique to minimize dust transmissions by more gently handling material and minimizing debris fall distance.</li>
                  <li>Completely cover all debris transport carriers before they leave the site.</li>
                  <li>Thoroughly wash sidewalks and road surfaces at the completion of the project.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Task Force supports the approach outlined above and feels this is the right direction in creating a stronger process for dealing with lead.</p>
        <p><strong>LEAD: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ABATEMENT</strong></p>
        <p><strong>RECOMMENDATION 6-1. The city and the DLBA should continue to require “wet/wet” demolition practices for dust mitigation in the permitting process.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>RECOMMENDATION 6-2. The city and the DLBA should engage with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and other regulatory agencies involved in contractor safety,</strong> to use Detroit’s large scale blight removal effort as an opportunity to research and develop enhanced air quality monitoring devices that monitor lead (expanding on the current asbestos air quality technology). The scale and speed of demolition in Detroit is unprecedented and can provide the platform for solutions that can be used across the country.</p>
        <p><strong>RECOMMENDATION 6-3. The city and the DLBA should engage with the U.S. EPA to explore resources and opportunities to assist smaller contractors</strong> with barriers they face acquiring air quality monitoring devices, including solutions for financial barriers.</p>
        <p><strong>RECOMMENDATION 6-4. The DLBA should continually work to enhance the MCI predictive prioritization tool</strong> (discussed in chapter 4) to include lead level indices, as they are collected in the field. This could lead to the establishment of a high health risk building removal indicator.</p>
        <p><strong>RECOMMENDATION 6-5. The DLBA should consider additional allocation of field liaisons as building removal activities continue to scale.</strong></p>
        
        
        <h4>DECONSTRUCTION</h4>
        
        <p>Deconstruction, or “salvaging,” is the exercise of human hands physically taking apart a structure. Deconstruction is an attractive choice for building removal for many reasons:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Resale opportunities,</li>
          <li>Waste diversion from landfills,</li>
          <li>Reduction of health impacts from dust particles spreading to neighboring structures (i.e., lead),</li>
          <li>Environmental sustainability,</li>
          <li>High-skilled job opportunities for Detroiters,</li>
          <li>Business development opportunities for Detroiters, and</li>
          <li>A sense of reclaiming Detroit’s past for craft and artisanal purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The Task Force wants to maximize the opportunity for deconstruction, while recognizing the current market demand for harvested materials, the increased costs, and impact of an expedited time schedule.</p>
        
        <p>The Task Force discussed a range
        of opportunities and challenges around deconstruction with six firms specialized in this type of removal. These discussions led us to select residential structures of four units
        or less as the best deconstruction candidates in Detroit. The current resale and wholesale distribution market can support deconstruction of only about 10 percent of Detroit’s present inventory of blighted structures in this category. That means that, under today’s conditions, about 7,000 buildings can be cost- effectively deconstructed and recycled. Even this modest volume would result in an estimated 30-
        35 new jobs in deconstruction and salvaging.</p>
        
        <p>An as-yet unexplored reason for deconstruction is the opportunity
        to bring the practice to a more ambitious scale of wholesale, through removal of significant quantities of building materials, especially roofing, trusses, and flooring materials. Although the capacity for this
        does not yet exist, the Task Force recommends exploring opportunities for wholesale-level engagement
        in deconstruction in the very near future.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Three deconstruction models are currently being used across the country:</strong></p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Full deconstruction</li>
          <li>Hybrid deconstruction</li>
          <li>Partial deconstruction (“skim” model)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Full deconstruction</strong> is just what it says: removing a structure entirely through manual deconstruction intervention. This practice usually takes anywhere from five to seven days or longer, depending on the size of the structure and costs approximately 50 percent more than mechanical demolition.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Hybrid deconstruction</strong> is gaining momentum in other markets across the Midwest. The hybrid method combines the presence of human beings on the site, along with an excavator. This variation of traditional deconstruction speeds up the work by using the excavator to carefully assist the manpower on the ground by gently pulling down walls, porches, roofs, staircases, and major elements. A crew of individuals can then get at these more easily, whether on site or for transport to a warehouse to be taken apart manually. This practice usually takes anywhere from one to three days, creates a lot of dust, and costs approximately 25 percent more than mechanical demolition.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Partial demolition,</strong> sometimes referred to as the “skim” model,
        is a nuanced version of the full deconstruction model. A <strong>“skim” model</strong> of deconstruction delicately balances the input (labor cost) with the throughput (salvaged materials of value) over a much shorter period of time -- one to three days versus five to seven days or longer for full deconstruction. Typical materials manually removed from the
        structure under a “skim” method of deconstruction are the higher-market resale items such as hardwood floors, trim molding, stained glass windows, doors, and door jams. In addition the estimated cost increase is only 10 to 12.5 percent more than mechanical demolition.</p>
    
    <p><strong>DECONSTRUCTION: RECOMMENDATION</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>RECOMMENDATION 6-6. At present capacity, the Task Force recommends starting with the “skim” model of deconstruction,</strong> where the property is appropriate and a market exists. The Task Force also recommends continually monitoring and expanding the envelope on this promising area
    of practice, as cost-effectiveness improves and markets change.</p>    
        
        <h3>DEMOLITION</h3>
        <p>Traditional, mechanical demolition will likely address 90 percent of all removal interventions necessary in Detroit. Mechanical demolition typically includes a three-person crew and can occur in as little as three hours once it has begun. A typical candidate for mechanical demolition is a structure with one or more of the following traits:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>The structure is on the city’s emergency demolition list and has to come down immediately;</li>
          <li>Structures that require significant asbestos abatement solutions which are typically too cost-prohibitive to be good rehabilitation or deconstruction candidates;</li>
          <li>The structure is in a defined geographic area with high levels of vacancy and blight, where there is an opportunity to demolish at some level of scale;</li>
          <li>The structure has fallen into a particular level of decay due to neglect, the elements, or a previous fire, and there is little or no salvage value remaining.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>DEMOLITION: RECOMMENDATIONS</strong></p>
        <p>The Task Force identified several recommendations for the city to implement, resulting in expedited demolition more promptly once approved, reducing health impacts, and removing bottlenecks in the process.</p>
        
        <p><strong>RECOMMENDATION 6-7. The Task Force recommends that the Detroit Land Bank Authority (DLBA) schedule all utility disconnections as soon
        as the contractors complete data gathering via the Strategic Assessment Triage Tool.</strong> The greatest practical challenge to prompt demolition in Detroit has been disconnecting the gas, electricity, and water lines to the property. Disconnecting utilities involves communication and timing issues among two different utilities and the city.</p>
        <p>After working directly with DTE Energy and the Detroit Water and Sewer Department (DWSD), the Task Force identified several efficiency opportunities for collaboration and cost savings between the DLBA, DTE and DWSD that should be implemented (some of these have already been implemented by the city and the DLBA):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Leverage the Motor City Mapping dataset to understand where disconnects have already occurred.</li>
          <li>Reduce demolition costs by identifying properties they have already been targeted for disconnect by DTE and/or DWSD.</li>
          <li>Schedule demolition for all structures on a block at the same time, which could result in one disconnect for the block instead of parcel by parcel disconnects, also reducing costs.</li>
          <li>Create joint action teams to disconnect utilities and water at the same time. Cross-training team members can result in greater efficiency, increasing overall capacity, and reducing overall costs.</li>
          <li>Qualify contractors to “cut & cap” the water line on site with proof that the job was done correctly, versus DWSD doing all the work themselves.</li>
          <li>Create a billing system that bills contractors on a time and materials basis versus a flat fee.</li>
          <li>For demolition work contracted by the DLBA, DWSD should allow contractors to proceed with disconnects and demolition BEFORE past due water bills on the property are paid.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          <strong>RECOMMENDATION 6-8. The city should continue to charge a discounted rate for demolition permits in light of the scale of need.</strong> The city’s Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental (BSEED) should remove the demolition permit fee.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>RECOMMENDATION 6-9. The DLBA should continue to use community meetings to engage community groups</strong> throughout the entire scope of planning and activation of demolition (or other interventions), in order to discuss and respond to community observations and concerns.
        </p>
        
        <h3>4. RECYCLING</h3>
        <p>Landfills in southeast Michigan have plenty of capacity to support the entire scope of blight removal suggested in this report. In fact with so much capacity, the prices for using Detroit’s landfills are low, inviting debris even from Canada. Still notwithstanding this capacity, the goal should be to recycle rather than filling up our existing landfills. The largest single cost factor for demolition in Detroit is the cost
        of trucking debris from the city to these landfill locations, which are generally located at least 30 miles from Detroit.</p>
        
        <p>Any recycling solution for the City
        of Detroit must therefore be located within the city limits. This would reduce the average demolition cost dramatically, considering the offset from recycling versus the hauling, fuel, tipping fees and limited hours of operation at the landfill. Recycling centers within the city of Detroit would also keep revenue from this project in the city, creating jobs for Detroiters. A recycling materials market must exist for recycling
        centers to make the investment
        in Detroit. Funding sources for deconstruction and demolition must be defined to support the need for recycling centers as well as contractor growth.</p>
        
        <p>The potential cost savings of two recycling centers within city limits is approximately 10 percent of total demolition cost per structure. If the average cost of demolition, including any deconstruction, is $10,000,
        this could save at least $1,000
        per demolition project. <strong>Assuming approximately 72,000 structural demolition candidates, this could result in a cost savings of up to
        $72 million.</strong> Locating two recycling centers within the city would cut
        the average trucking distance by one-half for demolition contractors. Contractors could also pay lower tipping fees through large-scale, pre- negotiated contracts with the Detroit Land Bank Authority.</p>
        <p>In addition, an anticipated 120 new jobs are possible through the creation of two recycling centers.</p>
        
        <p><strong>RECYCLING: RECOMMENDATIONS</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>RECOMMENDATION 6-10. The city should establish two new construction and demolition (C&D) recycling centers inside Detroit city limits;</strong> ideally,
        one on the east side and one on the west side of town. The Task Force sub- committee talked to three potential recycling center candidates, all with plausible business plans. All three candidates bring slightly different options and expertise, but may not represent the entire population of interested parties.</p>
        
        <p><strong>RECOMMENDATION 6-11. The Task Force recommends that the city’s
        Jobs & Economy team, with assistance from the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation, evaluate potential solutions and prioritize the selection, zoning, and economic support of at least two C&D recycling facilities in
        the city.</strong> Additional support from the state DEQ in delivering time sensitive support to navigating the regulatory and licensing requirements associated with opening this type of facility will add great value.</p>

            <h2>Large-Scale Commercial Structures</h2>
            <p>Large-scale, commercial structures include commercial structures with lot sizes greater than 25,000 square feet, and industrial structures. These structures are unique because of their larger size and their potential for greater environmental issues
            than other structures. Average costs for demolition can range anywhere from $1 million to tens of millions
            per structure. Although this category only represents a total of 559 structures, just 0.7 percent of the total structures that meet the Task Force definition of blight or have blight indicators in Detroit, they still represent a significant footprint in the city and need intervention. Without
            a solution, they will continue to exert a downward pull on any efforts to restore the neighborhoods in which they are located, and as well as on the city as a whole.</p>
            <p>Blighted, large-scale, commercial facilities are typically addressed
            by economic development teams, working to reactivate these sites
            and create jobs for a city. Detroit Future City (DFC) and the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation (DEGC) are already working side
            by side to overlay targeted primary and secondary employment districts in Detroit—based on the best available information about where the city’s jobs already exist or could grow—with DEGC’s economic development job creation strategies. The Task Force supports continuing these efforts while expanding
            the strategy to address both job creation and neighborhood recovery, reinvestment, and stabilization.</p>
            <p>A balanced two-objective approach is recommended in addressing large- scale commercial blight removal. This approach would balance the need to shore up tipping-point neighborhoods, while at the same time working toward investment and job creation.</p>
